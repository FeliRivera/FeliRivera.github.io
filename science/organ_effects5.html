            <h2>Cardiovascular System:</h2>
            <p>Sushi contains fish like salmon and tuna, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
                Omega-3s have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and
                improving cholesterol profiles. Regular consumption of sushi may contribute to better cardiovascular
                health and reduced risk of heart disease.</p>

            <h2>Digestive System:</h2>
            <p>Sushi often includes ingredients like seaweed, ginger, and fermented soy sauce (tamari), which have
                digestive benefits. Seaweed is rich in fiber, which promotes healthy digestion and regular bowel
                movements. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and aids in digestion by reducing nausea and
                bloating. Tamari contains beneficial enzymes that support gut health.</p>

            <h2>Immune System:</h2>
            <p>Sushi ingredients like raw fish and seaweed are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support
                immune function. Fish provides essential nutrients such as vitamin D and zinc, which are important for
                immune health. Seaweed contains vitamins A, C, and E, as well as immune-boosting antioxidants. Regular
                consumption of sushi may strengthen the immune system and enhance overall health.</p>

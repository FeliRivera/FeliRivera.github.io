            <h2>Cardiovascular System (Heart and Blood Vessels):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The heart pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs.
                </li>
                <li>Blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, transport blood to and from the heart and
                    other body parts.</li>

            <h2>Respiratory System (Lungs and Airways):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The lungs take in oxygen from the air we breathe and expel carbon dioxide, a waste product of
                    cellular metabolism.</li>
                <li>Airways, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, facilitate the exchange of gases between
                    the lungs and the environment.</li>

            <h2>Musculoskeletal System (Muscles and Bones):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Skeletal muscles contract and relax to produce movement, allowing us to walk, run, and perform other
                    physical activities.</li>
                <li>Bones provide structural support and protection for internal organs, as well as serving as a site
                    for mineral storage and blood cell production.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Nervous System (Brain and Nerves):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Walking stimulates the release of neurotransmitters and endorphins, chemicals in the brain that
                    promote mood elevation and reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
                <li>Regular physical activity, such as walking, can improve cognitive function, memory, and overall
                    mental well-being.</li>

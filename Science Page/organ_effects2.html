    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Cardiovascular System (Heart and Blood Vessels):</h2>
            <p>Playing soccer involves continuous movement, such as running and sprinting, which increases heart rate
                and blood flow. This improves cardiovascular health by strengthening the heart muscle and promoting
                better circulation throughout the body.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Respiratory System (Lungs and Airways):</h2>
            <p>Soccer requires aerobic activity, which enhances lung function and capacity. Increased breathing rate and
                oxygen intake support endurance and stamina during gameplay, improving overall respiratory health and
                oxygenation of tissues.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Musculoskeletal System (Muscles and Bones):</h2>
            <p>Playing soccer engages various muscle groups throughout the body, including the legs, core, and upper
                body. Dynamic movements such as kicking and jumping strengthen muscles, improve coordination, and
                promote bone density, reducing the risk of musculoskeletal injuries.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Endocrine System (Hormone-Secreting Glands):</h2>
            <p>Physical activity like soccer stimulates the release of endorphins, neurotransmitters that promote
                feelings of well-being and reduce stress. Regular exercise also helps regulate hormone levels,
                supporting metabolism and energy balance for overall hormonal health.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Nervous System (Brain and Nerves):</h2>
            <p>Soccer requires quick decision-making, spatial awareness, and coordination, which engage the brain and
                nervous system. Playing soccer stimulates neural pathways, improves cognitive function, and enhances
                motor skills, contributing to better mental acuity and cognitive health.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Immune System (White Blood Cells and Lymphatic System):</h2>
            <p>Moderate-intensity exercise, like playing soccer, can boost the immune system by increasing circulation
                and promoting the movement of immune cells throughout the body. Regular physical activity may reduce the
                risk of infections and chronic diseases by enhancing immune function and overall resilience.</p>

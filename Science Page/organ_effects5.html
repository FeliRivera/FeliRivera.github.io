            <h2>Cardiovascular System:</h2>
            <p>Sushi, particularly varieties containing fatty fish like salmon and tuna, is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
                Omega-3s have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering levels of triglycerides and
                improving cholesterol profiles. Regular consumption of sushi may contribute to better cardiovascular
                health and reduced risk of heart disease.</p>

            <h2>Metabolic System:</h2>
            <p>Lean fish used in sushi, such as tuna and mackerel, are excellent sources of protein. Protein-rich foods
                help boost metabolism, promote muscle growth and repair, and support weight management by increasing
                feelings of fullness and reducing appetite. Incorporating sushi into a balanced diet may aid in
                metabolic health and weight control.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Digestive System:</h2>
            <p>Sushi often includes ingredients like seaweed, ginger, and fermented soy sauce (tamari), which have
                digestive benefits. Seaweed is rich in fiber, which promotes healthy digestion and regular bowel
                movements. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and aids in digestion by reducing nausea and
                bloating. Tamari contains beneficial enzymes that support gut health.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Immune System:</h2>
            <p>Sushi ingredients like raw fish and seaweed are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support
                immune function. Fish provides essential nutrients such as vitamin D and zinc, which are important for
                immune health. Seaweed contains vitamins A, C, and E, as well as immune-boosting antioxidants. Regular
                consumption of sushi may strengthen the immune system and enhance overall health.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Bone Health:</h2>
            <p>Sushi containing fish with edible bones, such as sardines, provides a good source of calcium and
                phosphorus, essential minerals for bone health. Calcium is necessary for maintaining strong bones and
                teeth, while phosphorus plays a role in bone formation and repair. Including sushi with bone-in fish in
                your diet can support optimal bone health and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Mental Well-being:</h2>
            <p>Eating sushi, especially varieties containing fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, can benefit mental
                health. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish have been linked to improved mood, cognitive function, and
                reduced risk of depression and anxiety. Enjoying sushi as part of a balanced diet may contribute to
                better mental well-being and overall brain health.</p>

            <h2>Cardiovascular System:</h2>
            <p>Sitting for long periods can lead to decreased blood flow and circulation, increasing the risk of
                cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke. Blood pools in the legs, which can contribute

            <h2>Musculoskeletal System:</h2>
            <p>Prolonged sitting can cause muscle stiffness and weakness, particularly in the lower back, hips, and
                legs. It may lead to poor posture, muscle imbalances, and increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders
                such as back pain and neck pain.</p>

            <h2>Metabolic Health:</h2>
            <p>Sitting for extended periods is associated with metabolic changes, including decreased insulin
                sensitivity and impaired glucose metabolism. This can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and
                metabolic syndrome.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Digestive System:</h2>
            <p>Sitting for too long can slow down digestion and lead to constipation and bloating. It may also increase
                the risk of developing digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastroesophageal

            <h2>Skeletal System:</h2>
            <p>Sitting for long periods can contribute to bone density loss and weaken the bones, increasing the risk of
                osteoporosis and fractures, particularly in weight-bearing bones such as the spine and hips.</p>

            <h2>Circulatory System:</h2>
            <p>Sitting for extended periods can lead to poor circulation, especially in the legs. This can cause
